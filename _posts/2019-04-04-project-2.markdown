description: Earicle is a new assisted hearing device that is going to change your llfe! Look your conversation partner in the eye while wearing one Earicle to hear what they are REALLY thinking. It's probably fair enough to say that this was an April Fools project at GA. It was our first time working with developers. A 2-day sprint that was a lot of fun.
