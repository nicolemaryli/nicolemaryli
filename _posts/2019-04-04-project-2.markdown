description: Earicle is a new assisted hearing device that is going to change your llfe! Look your conversation partner in the eye while wearing one Earicle to hear what they are REALLY thinking. It's probably fair enough to say that this was an April Fools project at GA. It was our first time working with developers. A 2-day sprint that was a lot of fun.
discovery: <h4> The Problem </h4> <br> Whenever a new project is given, there is so much going on, that it’s hard to un ravel or digest all of the messiness, until the project is over. Hopefully because I’ve gone through the process, I can share what I have learned in an easily digestable way for you. <br> For this projecet, we were given most of the research results upfront. It was simply an opportunity to take what was given us, and create a website focusing on the goal of having users sign up for emails where they can learn more.  This is the prompt we were given from our instructors… <br> <br> <h4> Project Overview </h4> <br> This is what we got from our instructors… <br> <br> <a> <img src="img/earicle/project_overview.png"</a> <br> <br> "Earicle is a new assisted hearing device that is going to change your llfe! Look your conversation partner in the eye while wearing one Earicle to hear what they are REALLY thinking. But don’t stop there - two Earicles can extend your ‘hearing range’ 10s into the past and 10s into the future. Sign up now for our upcoming beta launch to be the first to get this amazing product. Supplies extremely limited." <br> It sounded more like a sales pitch, so we decided that we were making a landing page.  Right away (knowing we ultimately had little time) we looked up inspiration for marketing landing pages. Of course Apple was one that came to mind first, and they seem to constantly be showcasing soemthing new. Assuming Apple does pretty good with marketing their new technologies, we used their marketing page as a model to follow. Their website was separated into sections. <br> <a> <img src="img/earicle/apple_inspiration.png"</a> <br> We were also given a “User Stories” page that showed what the business needs and user needs were. Once again we had a bit to in order to create a finished product that met those needs. But it was good practice, because that’s part of what the job will be like in  an organization. In a bigger organization, I imagine this information could come from the Product Manager. In a start up, I may be required to get all of the information via research, and it would be critical to have more time to conduct and synthesize that research. <br> <br> <a> <img src="img/earicle/user_story.png"</a>  <br> <br> From this information, I mentally back-logged some ideas of how to best design for this user with the existing mail chimp forms. I did some sketches, to communicate to the developers what I expected the site to look like.  <br> <br> <a> <img src="img/earicle/first_sketches”</a> <br> <br> form options for users to choose what kind of info they wanted to receive to their inbox <a> <img src="img/earicle/form_one.jpg”</a> <br> <br> The sketches of those solutions looked like this... <br> <h4> Resaearch </h4> <br> This was the persona that we were given <br> <strong>  User Profile </strong> </li> <br> <li> Understands testing and beta programs </li> <li> Technically savvy, digital native, willing to take risks and experiment </li> <a> <img src="img/earicle/first_sketches”</a> <br> <br> <br> <li> <strong> Behaviors </strong> As a user, I… <br> <li> Want confirmation from the client that I am now on the list to receive notifications via email from the business </li> <li> Want to feel like I am getting something of value in exchange for my personal information</li> <li>Don’t want to get email spam</li> <li>Want to enter my personal information as quickly and easily as possible</li> <li>Am concerned about the privacy of my personal information</li> <li>Want to explore other areas of the site to learn more about the business </li> <li> Want to explore other areas of the site to learn more about the part of this business</li> <li>Don’t want to feel like I’m giving away my information to a third-party site </li> <li>Want to know that the sign-up experience is a legitimate and seamless</li>
