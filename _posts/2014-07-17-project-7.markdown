description: This client project was a 3-week sprint, and our captsone project at GA. We met remote with our client hoping to improve his product before it went out to market. 
discovery: Whenever a new project is given, there is so much going on that it’s hard to unravel or digest all of the messiness until the project is over. Hopefully because I’ve gone through the process, I can share what I have learned in an easily digestable way for you.

<h4> How did we discover what the problem was? </h4> 
First, we got a general view by speaking with our client. Our client was in UT, so we had to speak with him via Zoom.  He told us that  Treatment Coordinators don’t have enough time to keep up with clients, and they often loose them. With his new patient management system plug-in, Treatment Coordinators would be able to use a bot to automatically follow up with new leads and potential clients for follow up appointments.
