description: This client project was a 3-week sprint, and our captsone project at GA. We met remote with our client hoping to improve his product before it went out to market. 
discovery: Our client was in UT, so we had to speak with him via Zoom. He told us that Treatment Coordinators donâ€™t have enough time to keep up with clients, and they often loose them. With his new patient management system plug-in, Treatment Coordinators would be able to use a Bot to automatically follow up with new leads and potential clients for appointments.
